# E-Commerce Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning** using a synthetic e-commerce dataset. The dataset simulates a large-scale online store, allowing you to explore customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle – E-Commerce Dataset for Practice](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivrajguvi/e-commerce-dataset-for-practice)  
**Size:** 100,000 records  

### Features
- **Customer demographics:** age, gender, location, etc.  
- **Product details:** product ID, category, price, etc.  
- **Transaction information:** quantity purchased, date of purchase, total amount, etc.  

### Use Cases
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer and sales trends  
- Predictive modeling (e.g., sales forecasting, customer segmentation)  
- Data visualization and dashboard creation  
- Practice for real-world data science workflows, including data cleaning and feature engineering
